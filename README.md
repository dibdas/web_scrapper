# Web Scraping using Nokogiri 

<h2 align="center">Microverse-Ruby-Capstone-Project</h2>

## Definition of Web Scraping

Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler.
## Techniques

Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.

## About Project

The purpose of this project is to develop a scraper tool to achieve web-scrapping. This was achieved using Ruby,Nokogiri gem. The coursera page uses the production build of React which made the project more interesting to build.


- Nokogiri is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser. Among Nokogiri's many features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

- The above Ruby Gems can be sources from [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/)

In this project, I created a scraper which extracts free coursera courses from the [weworkremotely](https://weworkremotely.com/).

# Built With
 - Nokogiri 
 - RSpec 
 - Rubocop 
 - Ruby
